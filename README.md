# Objective Programming in CPP

This repository contains four exercises completed for the Objective Programming course during my second semester at WUT. The exercises include creating a **calculator, a histogram, a file-based histogram**, and the first stage of a group project for a **parcel warehouse**. This stage involved creating classes for different types of packages, each with its own characteristics.
